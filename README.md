## Description

#### Overview
This game is an adaptation of the game “Snake”. In our version of the game, the player has to eat the correct answer to the question flashed on the screen as well as avoid colliding with the walls, the snake body and eating the wrong answer. 

#### Target Audience
The target audience of our game are kindergarten kids who are learning simple math operations. Kids typically do not enjoy doing any sort of work. However, by repackaging math work as a game, they may be encouraged to learn math as they enjoy playing games and competing against one another. In this manner, they can learn as they play.


#### Main features that we wish to highlight
1. Storage and retrieval of player data in firebase (name and high score)
2. Dynamic creation of questions and multiple choice answers
3. Configurable game speeds to increase difficulty of game

#### Documentation
